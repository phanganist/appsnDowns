<p>Haad Rin is located at the very southern end of the island and, although it&rsquo;s known internationally as a party haven, there&rsquo;s much more to experience here. You can explore its beaches and hills either by foot or, for the more adventurous, by motorbike&mdash;though do be careful, as the hills can be quite steep.</p><h2>The Beaches of Haad Rin</h2><h3>Haad Rin Noi (Sunset Beach)</h3><p>On the western side, Haad Rin Noi offers one of the most breathtaking sunset views you&#39;ll ever witness on Koh Phangan. Imagine soft white sand, gentle waves lapping at your feet, and golden skies painting the horizon. It&rsquo;s quieter and more laid-back compared to its lively counterpart, making it a perfect spot to relax, read a book, or just enjoy a peaceful walk. The beach itself varies significantly with tides. At high tide, the beach shrinks, and swimming becomes tricky during low tide season (April to September) due to exposed reefs. Plus, the proximity of Haad Rin Pier means the water can occasionally be less clear. Nevertheless, the relaxed atmosphere makes this beach worth a visit.</p><h3>Haad Rin Nok (Sunrise Beach)</h3><p>Over on the eastern side is Haad Rin Nok, known worldwide for hosting the famous Full Moon Party. Beyond its party fame, this stretch of sand is truly idyllic, extending over a kilometer with crystal clear turquoise waters, vibrant beach vibes, and fantastic spots to lounge under the sun. It was among the first beaches discovered by travelers back in the 1980s and remains popular to this day. During daylight, it&#39;s a paradise for sun-worshippers, swimmers, and beach volleyball enthusiasts. By night, especially during full moon periods, the beach transforms dramatically, bustling with energetic crowds enjoying music, dancing, and drinks until sunrise.</p><p><img alt="Haad Rin Nok Beach" class="smugmug-image smugmug-image-large" src="https://phanganist.smugmug.com/photos/i-zKxzrKJ/0/L/i-zKxzrKJ-L.jpg" /></p><h2 id="full-moon-party-recommended-hotels">Recommended Hotels</h2><h3>Aquavana Resort</h3><ul><li><strong>Phanganist&#39;s #1 Recommendation</strong></li><li>Walking distance to Haad Rin Beach</li><li>Seaview rooms available</li></ul><p><img alt="Aquavana Resort - Koh Phangan, Thailand" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Articles-photos/Article-Photos/n-LTHNmq/2023-article-photos/i-W5J32Z5/0/4J8hvzRSMB46cqJCc2qkqFXPh8bbxgd2vHPmFzL2/XL/haad-rin-aquavana-XL.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;" /></p><p>The Aquavana Haad Rin Resort&nbsp;offers a prime location just a short walk from Haad Rin Nok Beach and nearby Haad Rin Pier, with easy access to Haad Yuan Beach and Haad Rin Nai Beach.
